Here's a **README** for your **Conversational Database POC**:

# **Conversational Databases POC**  
Convert natural language to SQL queries with LLMs  

## **Overview**  
This proof of concept demonstrates how **natural language statements** can be converted into **SQL queries** using **Large Language Models (LLMs)**. The platform enables seamless interaction with databases by interpreting user input and executing the generated queries against the connected database.  

Live Demo: (https://tatva-ui.vercel.app/))  

---

## **How It Works**  
1. Users input natural language queries.  
2. The platform uses **LLMs** (via prompt engineering) to generate corresponding SQL queries.  
3. The generated SQL query is executed by a backend API on the connected database (**Sakila MySQL**).  
4. Results are displayed to the user and stored in a MongoDB database for future reference.  

---

## **Tech Stack**  
### **Frontend**  
- **Next.js**: Provides a responsive, interactive UI for users to input queries and view results.  

### **Backend**  
- **.NET**: Handles API requests, processes SQL queries, and connects to the database.  

### **Database**  
- **Sakila MySQL Database**: Used for executing SQL queries and testing the POC.  
- **MongoDB**: Stores query history and results for reference.  

---

## **Features**  
- Converts **natural language** into accurate **SQL queries**.  
- Supports **prompt engineering** for improved LLM understanding and query generation.  
- Works with a preconfigured **Sakila database** for testing.  
- **Frontend** built for intuitive interaction and data visualization.

## **Setup and Installation**  

### **Prerequisites**  
- Node.js (for Next.js frontend)  
- .NET SDK (for backend)  
- MySQL (for Sakila database)  
- MongoDB  

### **Steps to Run**  
1. **Clone the repository**:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo-name/conversational-db-poc.git
   cd conversational-db-poc
   ```  

2. **Setup Sakila Database**:  
   - Import the Sakila database schema into your MySQL server.  

3. **Install Frontend Dependencies**:  
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```  

4. **Run the Backend**:  
   ```bash
   cd backend
   dotnet restore
   dotnet run
   ```  

5. **Connect MongoDB and Configure Environment Variables**:  
   - Add MongoDB connection details in the `.env` file.  

6. **Access the Application**:  
   - Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## **Future Enhancements**  
- Support for multiple database schemas.  
- Improved query accuracy with model fine-tuning.  
- Expanded model options and cloud-based deployment.  
- Real-time collaboration features.
